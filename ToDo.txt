[x]  Look at design materials (lite) -> elm-mdl
[x]  Use Elm-mdl sortable tables
[x] include mdl demo into app
[x] move HtmlUtils to elm root.
[x] refactor for single page app
[x] refactor for Navigation?
[x] get rid of standard template stuff from home page
[x] Use elm-mdl to add menu options for user and roles - this may require adding Navigation
[x] page for roles
[x] have selectable table and show roles.
  [x] for users
  [x] for roles


[] update user details on row select
[] Allow use of keyboard up and  down arrows in table

[] quicker way to find users.  Perhaps use map. red black tree?

[] add roles onto user page
  [x] update query to include join from user to roles.
  [x] update query to include join from user to roles - first pass.
  [] use grid to place two blocks side by side  mdl grid or flexbox

[] remove edit and delete buttons and replace with a single control


[] should users and roles just be on one page? or leave them as inverses of each other?
[] add authentication
[] add authorisation to adding user - system owner or delegate
[] workflow for signatures?


[] different colour for selected row
[] abstract selecting rows into reusable function?


[] when editing a record make sure that the correct record stays highlighted.
  [] consider whether we actually have to do a complete data fetch after an edit.
      ideally we just want confirmation that the update succeeded.
[] alias selectedUser as two integer representing index and id?
      it won't ever be the case that one integer is nothing and the other is not.

[] look at use of maybes and see if withDefault might help

  [] Use a separate directory for views?
  [] use static html file as container for s.p.a
  [] explore removing elm app from brunch scope - also from phoenix?.
