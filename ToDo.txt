[x] dont show precision form until edit actions
[] if the mode is edit or new, then buttons are cancel or save

[] when editing precision - precision text does not appear in text box
[] we need a separate cancel button for precision edit

[] it is not possible to select a precision after going into edit mode and cancelling



[] allow saving of equip class updates
