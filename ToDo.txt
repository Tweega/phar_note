[x] remove the user redundant fields from user model - nested scratchUser object
[x] use userWithRoles instead of plain User.
[x] display edit user casrd
[x] add roles to edit user card
[x] why are we populating user data on every table row click - we only need it on edit actions.



[] put selectedUserId and index behind a single maybe
[x] do card for new /edit user
[] post new user
  [] get server to process roles along with new user

[] put user


[] need to sort out just selectedUserID and index
[] userlist and filteredUserList - perhaps both do not need to be arrays?


[] after filter make sure a record is highlighted
[] make sure selected page is set back to 0 (or 1) after a filter
[] put filter page onto a tab alongside the user details Card
